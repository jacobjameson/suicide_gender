Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when they include a subset of ages 85-100+ because populations are not"
"available for those ages. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#Ages 85-100."
"2. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"3. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd-expanded.html#Unreliable."
"4. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"

"5. The method used to calculate 95% confidence intervals is documented here: More information:"

"9. The U.S. - Mexico Border Regions distinguish between counties near the U.S. - Mexico border in the border states of Arizona,"
"California, New Mexico, and Texas, and other areas. To simplify the Border region analysis, two mutually exclusive regions"
"within the United States are available: 1) U.S. - Mexico Border Region (i.e., 44 counties within 100 kilometers (62 miles) of"
"the U.S. - Mexico border), and 2) the U.S. Non-Border Region with the remaining counties of the selected four border states. The"
"Border counties selection was based on the 1983 La Paz Agreement:"
"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-09/documents/lapazagreement.pdf.. (i.e., counties for each state which fall"
"within 100 kilometers of the Border). Statistics are also available by each of the USA border counties along the U.S.-Mexico"
"area."
